This R Tool Detects Object Symmetry And Plots Estimated Paired Landmarks

#### Detecting object symmetry and setting up a matrix with paired landmarks can often be tedious and prone to errors. The R tool symmetry consists in two functions: detect.symmetry, and plot.symmetry. The first function detects paired landmarks in a dataset with object symmetry, and plots it using the mean shape coordinates for the whole dataset. The second function just plots the paired landmarks in order to double-check that our paired landmark matrix is correct.
